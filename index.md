# Guides Index

You can find two large sections of guides on this page. The first one is a large book-like introductionary guide. During 9 chapters you'll be brought through most widely-used parts of Joosy while creating a weblog software. You are supposed to read those chapters one by one. The other section includes independent guides on basic patterns for common tasks you will most probably meet during web development.

To learn Joosy you are supposed to completely read the introductionary part, then look through advanced part and start practicing watching the [API](http://api.joosy.ws/) for details.

## Creating a blog on Joosy

* ### [0. Joosy basics](guides/joosy-basics.html)

  This chapter describes ideology of Joosy, compares Joosy to alternatives and shares our vision of JS framework. We will create our future Blog application using generators and learn the directory structure.

* ### [1. Layouts, pages and routing](guides/layouts-pages-and-routing.html)

  In this chapter we'll create basic blog pages with layouts and learn how routing in Joosy works. We'll either learn how to load basic data from server during page load.

* ### 2. Elements, events and filters

  This chapter describes HTML elements and events binding. We'll add simple events to show number of comments next to blog's title using. We'll also discuss Filters, the powerful system of interaction with layouts/pages bootstrap.

* ### 3. Resources

  With help of Resources we'll improve our pages' fetch process, will add ability to delete posts. We'll either learn how to do inline resources mapping (like when you have `has_many` in Rails).

* ### 4. Dynamic rendering

  This chapter will show you what you can do with your resources and dynamic binding. We'll learn how to link variable value and its HTML representation which will automatically update after variable changes. Using that we'll add inline title editor to our blog.

* ### 5. Widgets

  In this chapter we'll move our inline title editor to a widget and will reuse it on all blog posts pages.

* ### 6. Helpers

  Using helpers we'll format blog posts content. This chapter either learns how to create local helpers accessible only inside views of one page.

* ### 7. Forms

  With help of Forms we'll finally add posts management to our blog. We'll make tiny admin pages to create and edit posts.

* ### 8. Preloaders

  Now that our blog is ready we'll improve its loading. This chapter will learn you how to use two different kind of preloaders that come with Joosy. You'll know their advantages and how you can use them.

* ### 9. Load, unload and "in progress" animations

  This is advanced chapter that will show you how you can get some advanced control over the process of pages loading. We'll add fading animation that will both: indicate the process of page loading and just look good :).
