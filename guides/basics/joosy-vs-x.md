### How is Joosy different from X

Joosy was created to be the foundation of a large browser applications. Since large applications are always tightly bound to a server implementation Joosy is not trying to achieve abstraction and independency. It uses Rails as an Application Server and lives among Views terms.

Talking about an MVC paradigm, Joosy is a View part while Controllers and Models are still in Rails. The great description of Joosy paradigm can be met at [Getting Started](/guides/basics/getting-started.html) guide. Please read it before passing on to direct comparison parts so you are sure to understand it correctly.

The another thing we inherit from Rails is a passion to have a nice set of ready conventions to solve common problems you meet day to day. Real-life orientation is a great Joosy feature. Most of conventions are shamelessly copied from Rails to ease adaptation and cooperation.
