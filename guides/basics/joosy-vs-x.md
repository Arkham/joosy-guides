## How is Joosy different from X

We share quite different goals and totally differ in ways to achieve it. While existing MVC frameworks define basic entities for you and leave you alone with application basic patterns and solutions, Joosy tries to give convention for each of them.

#### [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)

In Backbone or Spine you only have abstract Views, Models and "Packs of â€¦" and you should even decide on your own what's Controller for you. Joosy gives you the ready plan on how to move on to the success. If you ever used Rails you know that feeling: you concentrate on _what_ you create and not on _how_ to structure it.

#### [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)

Ember is the closest framework by spirit. But it still doesn't give you enough conventions and is even more abstract than Backbone in several parts. It either limits you to Handlebars. Joosy rendering system is built on top of same solution, Morpher. That said you can bind your variables dynamically just like in Ember. But it allows you to any templates syntax.
